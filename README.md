My app is called GameX. It is a discovery and recommendation app for gamers. Find the best games and start playing right away!

When you open the app, you will first see an introductory screen. Then you can view the game list on the home page. When you click on any game in the list, it will take you to the detail page of that game. When you reach the settings page, you can exit the app. When you exit, you will be automatically directed to the first page, the introductory page. You can also access the app source codes from the settings page.

You can follow it on Github:https://github.com/nihatydin/mobile-app
